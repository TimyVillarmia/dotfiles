# Agent routing

This repository contains portable personal AI-agent skills under `.agents/skills/`.

## Routing

- For .NET engineering work, use the `dotnet` skill.
- For creating or scaffolding .NET solutions, projects, or features, use `dotnet-scaffold` together with `dotnet`.
- Load only the references relevant to the task; do not duplicate their guidance here.

## Precedence

Repository/project-specific instructions and established conventions take precedence over global personal defaults. Explicit task requirements and security/correctness constraints take precedence over both.

## Tooling

Skills are tool-agnostic. Do not assume a specific MCP server, plugin, hook system, or coding-agent feature is available unless the current environment provides it.
